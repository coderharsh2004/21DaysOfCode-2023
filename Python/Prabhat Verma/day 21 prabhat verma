1. Write a Python function called "fizzbuzz_range" that takes two integers start and end as input. The function should generate and return a list of strings representing the numbers from start to end. However, replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz". If the number doesn't meet any of these conditions, simply include the number itself in the list.
def fizzbuzz_range(start, end):
    result = []
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            result.append("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            result.append("Buzz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return result

2. Write a Python function called "are_anagrams" that inputs two strings. The function should determine if the two strings are anagrams of each other (i.e., they contain the same characters, but possibly in a different order). The function should return True if the strings are anagrams, and False otherwise. Consider case sensitivity and ignore spaces in the strings.
def are_anagrams(s1, s2):
    s1 = s1.replace(" ", "")
    s2 = s2.replace(" ", "")
    return sorted(s1) == sorted(s2)
